            <h1>Don't Break The Bank To Become A Web Developer</h1>
            <h3>June 30th 2020</h3>
            <p>If you're looking to transition into a career in web development, one of the first things you're likely to Google is "Web Development Courses". You'll then be presented with a number of local training providers, and you'll browse through them one by one to determine which one you like the sound of, taking into account course content and price. Depending on the course you've chosen, you may be looking at costs of thousands of pounds. The course you like comes with career support, a personal tutor, and an in-depth course syllabus that will allegedly turn you in a Full Stack Web Developer in 6 months or less. You reason that you can't get that kind of value elsewhere without paying for an expensive course. You're looking to learn a whole new skill and become great at it, so it's best to pay top dollar as you know this will give you the most value, right? Wrong.</p>

            <p class="focus"><em>You can learn everything you need to become a great web developer, either for free online, or for small fees that won't require you to take out a loan.</em> </p>

            <p>To provide a bit of background to this article, last year I committed to paying over £3000 (after the interest was added) for a Full Stack Web Developer course. I fell into the trap of believing you had to pay a lot of money in order to get a high-quality coding course. The reality is that the internet is packed with so many free resources and the online programming community is so supportive that no training provider will ever get close to providing the same kind of value.</p>

            <p>There are three things I wish I knew before committing to forking out over £3000 for an online course:</p>
 
            <p class="p-list">1. Everything you need to know to get started is covered by <a class="link" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org.</a></p>
            <p class="p-list">2. YouTube contains plenty of high-quality free tutorials.</p>
            <p class="p-list">3. You can do this yourself. </p>
            


            <h3>Everything you need to know to get started is covered by freeCodeCamp.org.</h3>
            <p>FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit community that will teach you all the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also has thousands of hours of interview prep challenges. I often used freeCodeCamp to fill in some of the knowledge gaps in my course. Besides being completely free, the thing I like most about it is that it's all project based so you'll get to see practical applications of your code. </p>

            <h3>YouTube contains plenty of high-quality free tutorials.</h3>
            <p>Type in "html tutorial for beginners" and you'll see a number of in depth (1hour +) walkthroughs. Below is one example, released by the freeCodeCamp channel: </p>

            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQN-pnXPaVg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>   
            </div>

            <p>You'll find the same thing for CSS, and loads more for JavaScript. These are great because you can code along with the instructor so if something's not working you can see where you went wrong and correct it. You can also find great courses on Udemy that can cost as little as £15 if you take advantage of the discount codes frequently promoted on there.</p>

            <h3>You can do this yourself.</h3>
            <p>One of the big selling points of training providers is career support and personal tutors to assist you with any issues you have. From personal experience, it is definitely useful having a personal tutor but it's not something that you can't succeed without. Remember, Google is your friend. It's highly likely that whatever issue you're experiencing with your code has been experienced by someone else and has subsequently been resolved in a forum such as <a  class="link" href="#">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

            <p>You can also find a huge community of developers on platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. There's even community group chats on Slack and Discord that you can join to interact with other programmers, both those who share the same experience level as you and those who've been doing it for decades. So if by chance you can't solve your coding issue with a search engine query, you'll definitely get an answer if you reach out to the developer community on social platforms.</p>

            <h3>How to get started</h3>
            <p>My advice for anyone looking to get into Front-End development would be to start the curriculum provided by freeCodeCamp before breaking the bank for a course with a training provider. You will have learned the same things after completing freeCodeCamp's free course that you will have learned from completing a paid one, and you'd have the benefit of belonging to a community of other developers aspiring to the same goals as you.</p>

            <p>You can also take part in the 100DaysOfCode challenge, which is a fun way of holding yourself to account and becoming involved with the developer community.</p>
